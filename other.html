            <h4> Twice </h4>
            <p>Twice was the first K-pop group that I started following because their style of pop music instantly hooked me.
            The song "Fancy" which they released in 2019 is still one of my favorite songs to this day, and they were the group
                that really got me into k-pop. They are also an extremely successful group in Korea, making the most album sales
            domestically than any other group. </p>

            <h4> Loona </h4>
            <p>Loona is my favorite group of all time because of their insane diversity of music genres and the catchiness of every
                single one of their songs. Loona covers every genre of music, from rap to classical to bubble pop and even having some
                more somber songs. The variety of their songs is massive and they impress me everytime they make another music comeback.
                I highly recommend you to check out LOONA because I love every single one of their songs and they never disappoint </p>
