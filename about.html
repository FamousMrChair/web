            <h2> What is K-Pop?</h2>
            <p>K-pop is a new genre of music that grew in popularity starting in the early 2010s, 
        and then becoming a world phenomenon later on. K-pop is a genre of popular music originating in South Korea.
        It is influenced by styles and genres from around the world, such as experimental, rock, jazz, gospel, hip hop,
        R&B, reggae, electronic dance, folk, country, and classical on top of its traditional Korean music roots. This music genre
        has taken the world by storm and has received a massive following of both foreign and domestic fans, and I am personally a
        huge fan of the genre as well. </p>
