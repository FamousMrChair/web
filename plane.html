<h3> Why should you care about K-pop? </h3>
<p> K-pop is one of the most popular genres of music in the music industry right now, with the most popular K-pop group being BTS with over
160 million fans world-wide. They are only gaining popularity over the world and you probably already have a friend or a close relative who is
interested in their music. BTS and other K-pop groups are only growing in popularity, and it's better to join this hypetrain earlier than later.</p>
