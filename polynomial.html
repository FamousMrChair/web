        <h1> My Favorite Polynomial</h1>
        <p> Hello there! Before today, I have never had a "favorite" polynomial, but then Mr. Konstantinovich made a homework assignment that forced us to think about
        a polynomial that is our "favorite," and so I just made up a random 4 term polynomial! This is the polynomial that got lucky enough to be chosen by me :D </p>
        def makePolyTable(s,n):
           Table3 = "\n\t<table>\n\t\t<tr><th>x</th><th>y=4x^3+2x^2+7x+20</th></tr>"
           x = s
           while x <= n:
               Table3 = Table3 + "\n\t\t<tr><td>" + str(x) + "</td><td>" + str((3*(x ** 3)) + (2*(x ** 2)) + (7*x) + 20) + "</td></tr>"
               x += 1
               Table3 = Table3 + "\n\t</table>\n"
           print(Table3)
     

         print (makePolyTable (-2,5))
