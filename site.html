        <h1>What is K-Pop</h1>
        <p In this website, I'll go through a review on the global-rising phenomenon music genre known as K-Pop.
        K-pop (short for Korean popular music; Korean: 케이팝) is a genre of popular music originating in South Korea.
        It is influenced by styles and genres from around the world, such as experimental, rock, jazz, gospel, hip hop,
        R&B, reggae, electronic dance, folk, country, and classical on top of its traditional Korean music roots. This music genre
        has taken the world by storm and has received a massive following of both foreign and domestic fans, and I am personally a
        huge fan of the genre as well. </p>
