        <h1> Welcome! </h1>
        <p> My name is Kevin, and in this website, I'll go through a review on the global-rising phenomenon music genre known as K-Pop.
            There are links in the navigation bar that leads to an about page where I go into detail about what K-pop is, a page about BTS
            the most accredited and famous k-pop group as of now, and a page about some other groups that create great music and I personally
            enjoy listening to. </p>
